# Language-Learning-By_Comparison
    I will show you how to express what you want in difference languages, and it's an efficient way to learn language you want.
    As for me, I am a Chinese and I want to learn English now. How can I learn English in this way?
    
    Step 1
    You singn up on the website 'http://lang-8.com/'. 
    It's a language learning website. You write, the native speakers check and correct it for you, and as a return for this, you should do the same work. 
    Actually, I do not need to write. I make friends with some English speakers, and correct their entries written in Chinese.
    
    Step 2
    I copy and paste and group them. I try to understand what the writer want to express and learn how he or she write in his or her native 
language. Such as:
    
    The writer's original version:
    今天我上中文课.
    
    My correction:
    今天我有中文课
    
    The writer's native language version:
    Today I have Chinese class.
    
    The key to learn a foreign language is to compare it with your native language. I want to express something, in my native language, I say "...", in the language, I should say "...". It's funny and really effcient. That teaches us to think as a native speaker, and next time you want to express "I have Chinese class today", you say "今天我有中文课", instead of "今天我上中文课".
    
    Step 3
    Kepp it. Keep doing this, keep practice your aim language, speak that to your family, your friends even yourself. As for me, I always speak English or recipe English words when I am having a walk, waiting for a bus or on a bus. Remeber each success takes time.
    
    Those above are my experience in learning a foreign language. Hopefully it will help you.
    Thank for reading.
