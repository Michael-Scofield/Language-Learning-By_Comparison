请将下列段落译成英文:

	     大家好。 我叫Nicole。 我的中文名字叫妮科尔。 我是澳大利亚人。 我家有四口人。 我爸爸，妈妈，哥哥和我。 
我哥哥三十岁。 而我才十九， 他岁数有点大。 因为我家人都不会说汉语/我家里没人会说汉语, 他们都只说英语, 所以他们觉得我的汉语很好。 可是
我知道我说得没他们想得那么好。 我只会说大概七十个词， 他们却会夸我道：“哦，你真棒！”。 我也会说一点儿韩语。 有空的话，我想去韩国和
中国玩儿。 我喜欢吃辣，比如一些韩国菜和中国菜，但是我吃不了四川菜。 因为太辣了。 我有一个好朋友叫Melissa。 她不是大学生， 她在饭店工作。
 
	    Mine:
		
		Hi, everyone. I'm Nicole. My Chinese name is '妮科尔'. I'm a Australian. I have four people in my family: dad, mum, my brother and me.
My brother is thirty, he's fairly(a bit) old, I'm only nineteen. My family cannot speak Chinese, they only speak English, so they think my Chinese very good, but 
I know it's not as good as they think. I can say about seventy words, but they say'Oh, you're really good!' I can say a little Korea. I want to go to Korea and China 
in my spare/free time.I like spicy food, such as Korea food and Chinese food, but I can't eat Sichuan food, it's too spicy. I have a good friend named Melissa.
 She's not a university student,she works at a restaurant.
