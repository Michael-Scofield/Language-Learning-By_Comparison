		大家好。 好久没说过汉语了。 开学所以我要练习中文。今天我上中文课。 课四点钟开所以我可以睡懒觉。 因为我不会开车，太迟赶不上末班通勤车的时候，
		我爸爸开车送我回家。 今天回家的时候， 希望我爸爸给我买些东西吃。 谢谢您读我的字.

		Hello everyone.  It's been a long while since I last spoke Chinese. The semester has started,  so I want to practice Chinese. I have Chinese class today. Class starts at 4pm, so I can sleep in.
I can't drive so dad will drive me home when it's too late the catch the shuttle bus. Hopefully dad will buy me some food on the way home today.
